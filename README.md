# Bird counting in Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASNs)

This repository contains a Python implementation of a bird counting algorithm for Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASNs). The implemented algorithm is based on "Algorithm 1", which is presented in a paper by Gros-desormeaux et al. [[1]](#1). Some changes were made to the algorithm to allow interaction with classification results as produced by the BirdNET (https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET) classifier.
